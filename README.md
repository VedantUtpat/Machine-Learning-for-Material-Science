Mechanical properties of Cast Aluminum alloys  are predicted with the help of different Machine Learning Algorithms and developed models are evaluated by statistical tools.
39 alloys with temper gread as fabricated are taken to develop the models.
Random Forest, Support vector Machine,KNN are used to develop the model
Models are developed to predict the Mechanical properties like UTS, Fatigue strength, Tensile Yield strength.
